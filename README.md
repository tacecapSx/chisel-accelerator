# chisel-accelerator
A solution to assignment 3 of Computer Systems (02132) made by Martin Handest [s224755] ([@tacecapSx](https://github.com/tacecapSx)) and Oskar Holland [s224768] ([@pandekagee](https://github.com/pandekagee)) in Scala.

## Instructions
To test the CPU implementation, choose a picture inside of `SystemTopTester` by replacing the `image` variable. Then, to run the erosion algorithm, first enter `sbt`:
```
sbt
```

Then, run the test:
```
Test / runMain SystemTopTester
```
